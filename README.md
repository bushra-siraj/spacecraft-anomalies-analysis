# 🚀 Spacecraft Anomalies Analysis

### 📘 Overview
This project explores spacecraft operational data to identify and visualize trends in anomaly occurrences. The objective was to uncover potential causes behind system anomalies and understand how different parameters affect spacecraft performance.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

### 🔍 Key Steps
- Imported and cleaned raw spacecraft operational data  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect outliers and missing values  
- Visualized anomaly frequency, types, and system correlations  
- Interpreted results to highlight potential causes of frequent anomalies  

### 📊 Results
- Discovered patterns between specific systems and anomaly rates  
- Identified time-based spikes in anomaly occurrence  
- Provided data-backed insights useful for predictive maintenance studies
